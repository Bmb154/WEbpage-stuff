       	  <h3>When the world is going to shit...</h3>
        	<p>Sometimes what anyone needs is a place to vent, or just be free! And thats where the gym comes in! We are open to all schedules: Morning, Night, REALLY late night... whatever!
					 </p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Built on a Simple Philosophy</h3>
        	<p>When you design something from the ground up, you get to do it your way, and my gym was built with one thing in mind: Celebration. It's my personal view that excercise should
					never be something akin to a punishment; Training should not there to hurt you for that extra cupcake, punish you for enjoying a night out, or make you feel trapped. I want people to see
				what they can truly do when they put some effort in. Our entire lives are confinements; From quarintine to societal convention, we are always minding our surroundings--holding back for fear of breaking something.
			I want this place to be the opposite of that.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<h3>Constructed By hand</h3>
            <p>The Gym was completely builtfor the purpose of accessability, and it can be built again. Any damage the gym sustains was expected to happen, and what cant be predicted, can be repaired. I dont want people I share the Gym
						with to have to worry about dropping a weight, or bailing on a lift, this place is meant to keep the lifter safe and unhindered in their progress, even at the cost of a sheet of drywall (or two!) </p>
