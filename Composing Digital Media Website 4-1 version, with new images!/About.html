       	  <h3>Basic Info</h3>
        	<p>I'm a basic guy with a little bit of know-how, and a bit of ambition! The gym started off with me in my garage, lifting on a cheap 50$ bench because someone told me I needed to eat a sandwhich for the
						millionth time that week. I lifted because I hated myself, and that translated into me hating lifting. I quit for 2 years, and once again I started lifting around age 17 because the self hate got too bad
This time, however, I learned to actually lift correctly, and I started to care more about my progress (in the numbers I was lifting), rather than my looks. I forgot about the reason I started, and
got hooked on just enjoying letting loose for a bit. Numbers like 400lbs used to seem herculean, but now? I could comfortably pick that off the floor. Sure, people noticed I filled out, and DAMN did it feel good when the
comments started to be the opposite of what they were, but they werent the reason I kept at it... and I wanted to share that with other people. In total, two others have come along for the ride, and they both are going strong!
